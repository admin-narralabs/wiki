# Project Management Process

### Maintaining Project Board
1. One card should be equivalent to one commit
2. Card titles should be self explanatory and as simple as possible
3. Summary must contain a user story
4. Scenarios must be formatted using gherkin/cucumber format - this can be used to write automated tests later on
5. Use labels to determine parts of the project - frontend, backend, devops, admin, etc...
6. Always assign cards to the corresponding team member
7. Engineers should be responsible for updating their cards from start to finish
8. Project managers need to enforce all of the above
